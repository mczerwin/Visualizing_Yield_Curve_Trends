# Visualizing_Yield_Curve_Trends

After pulling this repo, install requirements if necessary.

The main functions are in view_heatmap.py, view_surface.py, view_spy_trend.py and best_fit_examples.py.

The first 3 scripts take two arguments, a starting year and an ending year. 

view_heatmap and view_surface both show how the yield curve changes over time. view_spy_trend compares the how slope of the linear regression fit of the yield curve changes over time, as well as the S&P500 index over time.

best_fit_examples shows examples of these linear regression slopes, as well as a more accurate cubic fit, since the yield curve is based off of a cubic spline model.
